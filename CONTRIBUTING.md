## ðŸ“Œ Setting up Locale Environment

### ðŸš© Forking repository :

1. Firstly you have to make your own copy of the project. For that, you have to fork the repository. You can find the fork button on the top-right side of the browser window. (Refer to the image below )
2. Kindly wait till it gets forked.
3. After that copy will look like `<your-user-name>/edu-client` forked from `codeforcause/edu-client`.

### ðŸš© Clone repository :

1. Now you have your own copy of the project. Here you have to start your work.
2. Go to the desired location on your computer where you want to set up the project.
3. Right-click there and click on `git bash`. A terminal window will pop up
4. Type the command `git clone <your-fork-url>.git` and hit enter. (Refer to the image to copy URL)

### ðŸš© Setting up remote :

1. Now you have to set up remote repositories.
2. Type 'git remote -v ' in the terminal to list remote connections to your repo.
3. It will show something like this:

```console

origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/edu-client.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/edu-client.git (push)

```

4. Now type the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/edu-client.git` this will set-upstream as the main directory.
5. Again type in the command `git remote -v` to check if the remote has been set up correctly.
6. It should show something like this :

```console

origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/edu-client.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/edu-client.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/edu-client.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/edu-client.git (push)

```

### ðŸš© Creating a branch :

Whenever you want to contribute to any project. It is a best practice that you should create a branch and push the branch as PR rather than directly pushing the main/master branch.

1. `git branch` will list all the branches in the repository.
2. Now type `git branch <your-branch-name>` to create your branch.
3. You can check the created branch by `git branch`
4. But still if you start editing the edits will go to the main branch. To change the path, type in `git checkout <your-branch-name>`
5. Now you are ready to do the desired changes.

## ðŸ“Œ Setting up .env file :

1. Create a new file `.env` in the root directory.
2. Copy all the default content from the `.env.example` file to the `.env` file.
3. You can edit this `.env` file to provide your own project credentials if needed in the future for specific tweaks and tests.


## ðŸ“Œ Setting up project using `npm` :

1. Open this cloned folder in the text editor of your choice.
2. If you want to use the project using `npm` then that comes alongside when you download and install node js.
