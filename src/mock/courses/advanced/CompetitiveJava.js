  overview: [
    "During the course, you’ll learn everything needed to participate in real competitions — that’s the main goal. Along the way you’ll also gain useful skills for which competitive programmers are so highly valued by employers: ability to write efficient, reliable, and compact code, manage your time well when it’s limited, apply basic algorithmic ideas to real problems, etc.",
    "We start from the very beginning by teaching you what competitions there are, what are their rules, what specifics problems have, how to read problem statements, how to organize your work, and what you should and shouldn’t do. So it’s fine if you’ve never taken part in programming competitions before.",

  faqs: [
    {
      title: "Will this help me with my career path?",
      answer:
        "Yes. If you learn well, all that the course intends to teach, you’ll be able to impress quite a few interviewers across quite a few fine companies.",
    },
    {
      title: "How your doubts will get resolved?",
      answer:
        "We have an army of TA’s who are available in different time slots to resolve all your doubts. You can also interact with faculty through Slack.",
    },
    {
      title: "Is this course suitable for me?",
      answer:
        "Definitely! If you want to shift to software developer career path, then this course is perfect for you!",
